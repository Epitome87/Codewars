# 5 Without Numbers!!

## Description

Write a function that always returns `5`

Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: `0123456789*+-/`

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const unusualFive = () => 'Matt!'.length;
```

```js
const unusualFive = () => 'abcdef'.indexOf('f');
```
