## Description

This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?

**Original Code**

```js
var a == "code";
var b == "wa.rs";
export var name == a + b;
```

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const a = 'code';
const b = 'wa.rs';
const name = a + b;
```

**TypeScript**

```ts
const a = 'code';
const b = 'wa.rs';
export const name = a + b;
```

**Python**

```py
a = "code"
b = "wa.rs"
name = a + b
```
