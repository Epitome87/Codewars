# [[BUG] XCOM-409: Flight Distance of Interceptor Planes is Miscalculated](https://www.codewars.com/kata/67b7a527c9f842fd3b02adb8)

## Description

You are an intern working in the software development department of the X-COM agency, responsible for fighting off a large-scale invasion of extraterrestrials. Your task for today is described with the bug report below:

### \[BUG\] XCOM-409: Flight distance of Interceptor planes is miscalculated

**Type:** Bug ðŸª³  
**Priority:** Major  
**Component:** Operational Logistics Software  
**Reporter:** `maverick`  
**Assignee:** _Assigned to you_

---

#### Bug Description

Pilots have reported discrepancies in their flight logs after returning from interception missions. The **travel distance** logged in the logistics software does not match actual flight paths, potentially leading to incorrect fuel calculations and errors in planning of future missions.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1.  Deploy an interceptor to engage a UFO.
2.  Upon its return, note the average speed (given in **knots**) and travel time (in **minutes**) reported by onboard instruments.
3.  Enter the values into the Logistics and Planning System.
4.  Expected result: The system should correctly compute the **distance in kilometers**.
5.  Actual result: The logged distance appears **inaccurate**.

#### Impact

If not fixed, this could cause interceptors to **run out of fuel mid-mission**, leaving Earth vulnerable to alien attacks. On the other hand, if the system **overestimates travel distance**, interceptors may be **overfueled**, making them heavier than necessary. This reduces **maneuverability**, increases **takeoff time**, and could put pilots at a disadvantage during high-speed engagements with alien craft.

The Flight Operations team has requested an immediate fix.

#### Task

Investigate and fix the bug in the travel distance calculation function.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
// speed of aircrafts is given in *knots*
// travelTime is in *minutes*
// travel distance should be returned in *kilometers*
const travelDistance = (avgSpeed, travelTime) => {
  const KM_PER_KNOT = 1.852;
  const HOURS_PER_MINUTE = 1 / 60;

  const travelHours = travelTime * HOURS_PER_MINUTE;
  const travelKnots = avgSpeed * travelHours;
  const travelKms = travelKnots * KM_PER_KNOT;

  return travelKms;
};
```

**Python**

```py
def travel_distance(avg_speed, travel_time):
    KM_PER_KNOT = 1.853
    travel_hours = travel_time / 60
    travel_knots = avg_speed * travel_hours
    travel_kms = travel_knots * KM_PER_KNOT
    return travel_kms
```
