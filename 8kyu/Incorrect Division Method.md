# [Incorrect Division Method](https://www.codewars.com/kata/54d1c59aba326343c80000e7)

## Description

This method, which is supposed to return the result of dividing its first argument by its second, isn't always returning correct values. Fix it.

Original (Python) code:

```py
def divide_numbers(x,y):
    return x // y
```

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const solve = (x, y) => x / y;
```

**Python**

```py
def divide_numbers(x, y):
    return x / y
```
