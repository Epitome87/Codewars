# [Not So Black Box](https://www.codewars.com/kata/57080f21d531cd94950007eb)

## Description

The kata has been preloaded with a function called blackBox. Figure out what the function does.

You may need to think laterally!

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
JSopenSesame();
```

# Takeaways

1. Not too much of a programming challenge. The one programming-related aspect needed to solve this was to know that to view the contents of a function, we write the function name followed by `.toString()`. After doing so, we are given the solution to the Kata!
