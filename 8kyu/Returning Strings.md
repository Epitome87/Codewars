# [Returning Strings](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55a70521798b14d4750000a4)

## Description

Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, `"Hello, <name> how are you doing today?"`.

[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;
```

**Python**

```py
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name} how are you doing today?"
```
