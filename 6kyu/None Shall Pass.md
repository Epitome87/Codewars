# [None Shall Pass](https://www.codewars.com/kata/525988ee6021e918e6000dce)

## Description

The black knight moves for no man.
However, you are no mere man; you are Arthur, King of the Britons.
You have no quarrel with good sir knight, but you must cross this bridge!

If this description does not make sense to you: the kata is a reference to [Monty Python And The Holy Grail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eMkth8FWno).

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
BlackKnight.letsYouPass = () => true;
```
