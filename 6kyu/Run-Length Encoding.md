# [Run-Length Encoding](https://www.codewars.com/kata/546dba39fa8da224e8000467)

## Description

```
Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. Wikipedia
```

**Task**

Your task is to write such a run-length encoding. For a given string, return a list (or array) of pairs (or arrays) [ (i1, s1), (i2, s2), â€¦, (in, sn) ], such that one can reconstruct the original string by replicating the character sx ix times and concatening all those strings. Your run-length encoding should be minimal, ie. for all i the values si and si+1 should differ.

**Examples**

As the article states, RLE is a very simple form of data compression. It's only suitable for runs of data, as one can see in the following example:

```js
runLengthEncoding('hello world!');
//=>      [[1,'h'], [1,'e'], [2,'l'], [1,'o'], [1,' '], [1,'w'], [1,'o'], [1,'r'], [1,'l'], [1,'d'], [1,'!']]
```

It's very effective if the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements:

```js
runLengthEncoding('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaabbb');
// => [[34,'a'], [3,'b']]
```

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const runLengthEncoding = (str) => {
  const result = [];
  if (!str.length) return result;

  let curCount = 1;
  let prevChar = str[0];

  for (let i = 1; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i] === prevChar) curCount++;
    else {
      result.push([curCount, prevChar]);
      prevChar = str[i];
      curCount = 1;
    }
  }

  result.push([curCount, prevChar]);

  return result;
};
```

### User Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const runLengthEncoding = (str) => (str.match(/(.)\1*/g) || []).map((val) => [val.length, val[0]]);
```

```js
function runLengthEncoding(str) {
  const arr = [];
  let counter = 1;

  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i] === str[i + 1]) {
      counter++;
    } else {
      arr.push([counter, str[i]]);
      counter = 1;
    }
  }

  return arr;
}
```
