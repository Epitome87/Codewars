# [Ordering the Words!](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55d7e5aa7b619a86ed000070)

## Description

Given a string, you need to write a method that order every letter in this string in ascending order.

Also, you should validate that the given string is not empty or null. If so, the method should return:

```
"Invalid String!"
```

**Notes**

- the given string can be lowercase and uppercase.
- the string could include spaces or other special characters like '# ! or ,'. Sort them based on their ASCII codes

**Examples**

```
"hello world" => " dehllloorw"
"bobby"       => "bbboy"
""            => "Invalid String!"
"!Hi You!"    => " !!HYiou"
```

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const orderWord = (s) => (s ? [...s].sort().join('') : 'Invalid String!');
```

```js
const orderWord = (s) => [...(s || '')].sort().join('') || 'Invalid String!';
```
