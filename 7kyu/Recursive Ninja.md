# [Recursive Ninja](https://www.codewars.com/kata/583ed487ee36e2a8d20000e8)

## Description

Ninjas frequently need to signal each other in code, often employing natural sounds as a cover. Weâ€™re going to give our ninja the ability to chirp like a cricket, with the number of chirps encoding different messages.

Implement a "recursive function" that takes one parameter (n) and outputs a string i.e.

```js
chirp(4);
//output would be chirp-chirp-chirp-chirp.
```

javascript/coffescript: don't use the String method .repeat(), write a recursive function, remember you're a Ninja!

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const chirp = (n) => (n < 1 ? '' : n === 1 ? 'chirp' : 'chirp-' + chirp(n - 1));
```

### User Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const chirp = (n) => (n > 1 ? 'chirp-' + chirp(n - 1) : 'chirp');
```
