## Description

**A square of squares**

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

**Task**

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

**Examples**

```
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
```

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const isSquare = (n) => n ** 0.5 % 1 === 0;
```

```js
const isSquare = (n) => Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n));
```

**Python**

```py
import math

def is_square(n):
    return False if n < 0 else math.sqrt(n) ** 2 == n
```

### User Solution

**Python**

```py
import math
def is_square(n):
    return n > -1 and math.sqrt(n) % 1 == 0
```

```py
def is_square(n):
    return n >= 0 and (n**0.5) % 1 == 0
```
