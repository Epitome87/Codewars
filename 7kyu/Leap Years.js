/*
In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

years divisible by 4 are leap years
but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
but years divisible by 400 are leap years
Additional Notes:

Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them
Examples can be found in the test fixture.
*/

// My original solution:
const isLeapYear = (year) => {
  if (year % 400 === 0) return true;
  if (year % 100 === 0) return false;
  if (year % 4 === 0) return true;

  return false;
};

// Top user solution:
function isLeapYear(year) {
  return (year % 100 !== 0 && year % 4 === 0) || year % 400 === 0;
}
