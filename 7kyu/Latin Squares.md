# [Latin Squares](https://www.codewars.com/kata/645fb55ecf8c290031b779ef)

## Description

A **latin square** is an n Ã— n array filled with the integers 1 to n, each occurring once in each row and column.

Here are examples of latin squares of size 4 and 7:

```
[[1, 4, 3, 2],      [[2, 3, 1, 7, 4, 6, 5],
 [4, 3, 2, 1],       [7, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4, 3],
 [3, 2, 1, 4],       [6, 7, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2],
 [2, 1, 4, 3]]       [4, 5, 3, 2, 6, 1, 7],
                     [5, 6, 4, 3, 7, 2, 1],
                     [1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 5, 4],
                     [3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 7, 6]]
```

Latin squares have many practical uses, for example in error-correcting-codes and the design of agricultural experiments. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square for more details. Sudoku is a special type of 9 x 9 latin square, with additional conditions.

Task: Write a function that returns a latin square for any positive integer n.

And please take a look at Latin Square Validator. (Since it's in beta, you won't get the expected number of points for solving it. But you can help get it approved by giving it a good rating, and then you will get the points once it is approved.)

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const makeLatinSquare = (n) => [...Array(n)].map((_, r) => [...Array(n)].map((_, c) => ((r + c) % n) + 1));
```

```js
const makeLatinSquare = (n) => {
  const result = [];
  for (let r = 0; r < n; r++) {
    result.push([...Array(n)].map((_, idx) => ((idx + r) % n) + 1));
  }
  return result;
};
```

```js
const makeLatinSquare = (n) => {
  const result = [];

  for (let r = 0; r < n; r++) {
    const row = [];
    for (let c = 0; c < n; c++) {
      row.push(((c + r) % n) + 1);
    }
    result.push(row);
  }

  return result;
};
```
