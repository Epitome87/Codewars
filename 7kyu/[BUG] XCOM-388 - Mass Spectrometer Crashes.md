### \[BUG\] XCOM-388: Mass spectrometer crashes when evaluating large samples of E-115

**Type:** Bug ðŸª³  
**Priority:** Major âš¡  
**Component:** Mass spectrometer  
**Reporter:** `gfreeman`  
**Assignee:** _Assigned to you_

#### Description of the Bug

The mass spectrometer built by X-COM engineers for researching ultra-heavy atoms of E-115 crashes when filled with large samples. This was not a problem until now because samples obtained from crashed ships were very scarce and contained trace amounts of E-115. However, agents recently managed to obtain an unscratched container from an undamaged, landed scout ship. Unfortunately, a large sample of ca. 1 million atoms of E-115 extracted from it caused our equipment to crash.

Additionally the device breaks when powered on without any sample inserted. This has to be fixed too.

#### Expected behavior

- The device is able to determine the atomic mass of the heaviest atom in a sample of up to 1 million atoms.
- The device must be calibrated to point to 0 when no sample is present.

#### Additional Info

The spectrometer is used to analyze atoms in a sample of E-115 and determine the heaviest isotope present. The most common isotopes have atomic masses between 286 and 290 and are of no special interest. However, theory suggests the possible existence of 115292E \_{115}^{292}E 115292â€‹E atoms, and finding such an isotope would be a major breakthrough in our research.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const Spectrometer = {
  getHeaviest: (atomicMasses) => atomicMasses.reduce((acc, cur) => Math.max(acc, cur), 0),
};
```
