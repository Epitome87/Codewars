# [Billiards Triangle](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5bb3e299484fcd5dbb002912)

## Description

Remember the triangle of balls in billiards? To build a classic triangle (5 levels) you need 15 balls. With 3 balls you can build a 2-level triangle, etc.

For more examples,

```
pyramid(1) == 1

pyramid(3) == 2

pyramid(6) == 3

pyramid(10) == 4

pyramid(15) == 5
```

Write a function that takes number of balls (â‰¥ 1) and calculates how many levels you can build a triangle.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const pyramid = (balls) => ((Math.sqrt(balls * 8 + 1) - 1) / 2) ^ 0;
```

### User Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
function pyramid(balls) {
  var level = 0;
  while (balls >= level + 1) {
    level++;
    balls -= level;
  }
  return level;
}
```
