/*
In JavaScript there are truthy and falsy values:

truthy: a value that when evaluated in a boolean context returns true
falsy: a value that when evaluated in a boolean context returns false

Your task
You are given two empty arrays (truthy and falsy) and you have to fill this array with at least 5 elements in each which will evaluate to true or false accordingly.

// My solution:
const truthy = [true, 1, 'Not empty', {}, []];
const falsy = [false, 0, '', null, undefined];
