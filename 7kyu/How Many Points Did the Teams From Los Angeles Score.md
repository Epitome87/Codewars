# [How Many Points Did the Teams From Los Angeles Score?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/580559b17ab3396c58000abb)

## Description

You are given an array including a list of basketball teams and their scores showing points scored vs points lost:

```js
const basketballResults = [
  ['Dallas Mavericks', '492:513'],
  ['Los Angeles Lakers', '641:637'],
  ['Houston Rockets', '494:458'],
  ['Los Angeles Clippers', '382:422'],
  ['New Orleans Pelicans', '433:454'],
  ['Oklahoma City Thunder', '315:318'],
  ['Golden State Warriors', '559:503'],
  ['Memphis Grizzlies', '550:511'],
  ['Portland Trail Blazers', '527:520'],
  ['Minnesota Timberwolves', '495:494'],
  ['Utah Jazz', '399:402'],
  ['Sacramento Kings', '420:431'],
  ['San Antonio Spurs', '469:460'],
  ['Phoenix Suns', '523:522'],
  ['Denver Nuggets', '646:658'],
];
```

Your task it to return a number which represents the total number of points scored by a team from Los Angeles.

In the above example the correct result is a number of 1023, as Los Angeles Lakers got 641 and Los Angeles Clippers got 382, so 641 + 382 = 1023.

Notes:

- The format of the Los Angeles team name will always start with 'Los Angeles' followed by one-word team name, for example, 'Los Angeles Name'.
- All letters will be in lower-case apart from first letters which will be in upper-case. Only letters will be used (no numbers, underscores, hyphens, special characters etc.)
- For example, the following strings do not represent a team from Los Angeles: 'Happy Los Angeles', 'Los Angeles', Los Angelesio Thunders', 'los angeles masters'.
- The number of teams from Los Angeles may vary.
- If there are no teams from Los Angeles, return the number 0.
- The order of the teams may vary.
- All values in the arrays will always be strings.
- Points will always be given in the following format '100:99' (points scored:points lost).

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const getLosAngelesPoints = (results) =>
  results.reduce((acc, cur) => acc + (/^Los Angeles \D+$/.test(cur[0]) ? +cur[1].split(':')[0] : 0), 0);
```
