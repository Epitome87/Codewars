# [PatternCraft - Adapter](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56919e637b2b971492000036)

## Description

The Adapter Design Pattern can be used, for example in the StarCraft game, to insert an external character in the game.

The pattern consists in having a wrapper class that will adapt the code from the external source.

**Your Task**

The adapter receives an instance of the object that it is going to adapt and handles it in a way that works with our application.

In this example we have the pre-loaded classes:

```js
class Marine {
  attack(target) {
    target.health -= 6;
  }
}

class Zealot {
  attack(target) {
    target.health -= 8;
  }
}

class Zergling {
  attack(target) {
    target.health -= 5;
  }
}

class Mario {
  jumpAttack() {
    console.log('Mamamia!');
    return 3;
  }
}
```

Complete the code so that we can create a MarioAdapter that can attack as other units do.

Note to calculate how much damage mario is going to do you have to call the jumpAttack method.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
class MarioAdapter {
  constructor(mario) {
    this.mario = mario;
  }

  attack(target) {
    target.health -= this.mario.jumpAttack();
  }
}
```
