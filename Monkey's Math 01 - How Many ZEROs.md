# [Monkey's Math 01: How Many "ZERO"s?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56c2acc8c44a3ad6e400050a)

## Description

Gigi is a clever monkey, living in the zoo, his teacher (animal keeper) recently taught him some knowledge of "0".

In Gigi's eyes, "0" is a character contains some circle(maybe one, maybe two).

So, a is a "0",b is a "0",6 is also a "0"，and 8 have two "0" ,etc...

Now, write some code to count how many "0"s in the text.

Let us see who is smarter? You ? or monkey?

Input always be a string(including words numbers and symbols)，You don't need to verify it, but pay attention to the difference between uppercase and lowercase letters.

Here is a table of characters：

```
one zero	abdegopq069DOPQR         () <-- A pair of braces as a zero
two zero	%&B8
```

Output will be a number of "0".

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const countzero = (s) =>
  s
    .replace(/[abdegopq069DOPQR]/g, '0')
    .replace(/\(\)/g, '0')
    .replace(/[B8%&]/g, '00')
    .replace(/[^0]/g, '').length;
```

### User Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const countzero = (s) =>
  (
    s
      .replace(/\(\)|[abdegopq069DOPQR]/g, `0`)
      .replace(/[%&B8]/g, `00`)
      .match(/0/g) || []
  ).length;
```
