# [The Soul of Wit: Reverse an Array](https://www.codewars.com/kata/https://www.codewars.com/kata/59b81886460387d8fc000043)

## Description

No time for stories. Reverse an array, return the result. Do whatever you want with the original array. Don't use `Array.prototype.reverse`.

You have 30 bytes to spare.

Example: `[1, 2, 3] â†’ [3, 2, 1]`

And this time you won't be able to do the thing from that kata.

`require` isn't allowed as well.

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
reverse = (a) => [...a].map(a.pop, a);
```

### User Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
reverse = (a) => a.map(a.pop, [...a]);
```
