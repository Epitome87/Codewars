# [I Spy](https://www.codewars.com/kata/555185132c0d4cca3d000197)

## Description

NOTE: The test cases for this kata are broken, but for some reason CodeWars has locked them and I cannot edit them. Specifically, the returned function is not propertly testing that old values are remembered. If and when I can fix the problem, I will, but I don't see any way to do that due to the lock.

In testing, a spy function is one that keeps track of various metadata regarding its invocations. Some examples of properties that a spy might track include:

- Whether it was invoked
- How many times it was invoked
- What arguments it was called with
- What contexts it was called in
- What values it returned
- Whether it threw an error

For this kata, implement a spyOn function which takes any function func as a parameter and returns a spy for func. The returned spy must be callable in the same manner as the original func, and include the following additional properties/methods:

.callCount() â€” returns the number of times spy has been called
.wasCalledWith(val) â€“ returns true if spy was ever called with val, else returns false.
.returned(val) â€” returns true if spy ever returned val, else returns false
Below is a specific example of how spyOn might work in the wild.

function adder(n1, n2) { return n1 + n2; }
var adderSpy = spyOn( adder );

adderSpy(2, 4); // returns 6
adderSpy(3, 5); // returns 8
adderSpy.callCount(); // returns 2
adderSpy.wasCalledWith(4); // true
adderSpy.wasCalledWith(0); // false
adderSpy.returned(8); // true
adderSpy.returned(0); // false

## My Solution

**JavaScript**

```js
const spyOn = (func) => {
  let count = 0;
  let calls = new Set();
  let returns = new Set();

  const spy = (...args) => {
    args.forEach((arg) => calls.add(arg));
    const returnValue = func(...args);
    returns.add(returnValue);
    count++;
    return returnValue;
  };

  spy.callCount = () => count;
  spy.wasCalledWith = (n) => calls.has(n);
  spy.returned = (n) => returns.has(n);

  return spy;
};
```
